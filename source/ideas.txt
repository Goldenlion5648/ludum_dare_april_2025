tangrams levels



dealing damage:

enemy attacks



abilities
shift a row


have dice pool to choose from  (say 6 total)

predetermine order of them? then throw the next 3 (serving as a queue)
each turn throw 3 (maybe 2?) of them and put back in the queue
(maybe have ability to move position of die still in queue)



DDM issues:
can spam level 1 monsters and block out opponent
AI was not good


ability ideas
send one time spirit to move and attack in player's place
keep moving in same direction like thunder ball
ranged attack
shield (turn ends, reduces damage)


most turn based tactics games:
have perma death
turn based
move certain number of spaces to take down enemy


allow converting enemy tiles to your own

some or all levels like minecraft sculk
get from point A to B while all the area around B has infectious blocks that spread to your own

have terrain that blocks movement


have resources on map that players want to race to
have question mark blocks with unknown resource

wall between sides until turn 5


real time mode
instead of attack center of opponent's side, they have one unit that runs around
goal defeat all preplaced units on board



splatoon game
asymmetric board


apply status effect


breakable obstacle
replace with empty space
walls

environemental effect
destroy spot on grid
game of life tiles

5 dice

enclosing area like Go game captures it

make board require balance like yali
